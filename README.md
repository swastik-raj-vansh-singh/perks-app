# Perks Homepage

This is a small project I made as part of a frontend assignment.  
The goal was to recreate a perks or benefits homepage layout using only HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript.

## What I Used

- HTML for structure  
- CSS for styling and layout  
- JavaScript to create the perk cards dynamically from an array

## What the Page Does

- It shows a list of perks in card format
- All the cards are created using a JavaScript array
- The layout is responsive for mobile and tablet
- I also added a small hover effect to each card

## How to Run

Just open the `index.html` file in your browser.  
You don’t need to install anything.

## Notes

I’m still learning frontend development, so I kept the code simple and clean.  
Everything is done without any frameworks or libraries.
